  - Gender and Age Groups
  - Flight Distance
- Design a professional, user-friendly Power BI dashboard

## Tools & Skills Applied

- **Power BI Desktop** for visualization and modeling
- **Power Query** for data cleaning and transformation
- **DAX** for calculated measures and KPIs
- **Smart Narrative** for automated insights
- **Custom layout design** to mirror real-world BI dashboards

## Key Insights

- **Business class** passengers reported the highest satisfaction.
- **Seat Comfort**, **Cleanliness**, and **Check-in Service** were strong predictors of satisfaction.
- **Economy class** had the widest variation in experience.
- Passengers on longer flights tended to report higher satisfaction.
